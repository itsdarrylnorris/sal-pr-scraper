### Sal.pr Scrapper

Scrapes restaurants from Sal.pr and turns them into a CSV file.

I took the liberty to export the CSV file and import them into Notion. Feel free to get the data from [this Notion page](https://www.notion.so/itsdarrylnorris/4882cba73bc344179ca3fe0db636c1dd?v=dd0262200b6940a480b97db51fc52013).
